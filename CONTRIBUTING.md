# Contributing to Gatling Kafka Extension

Thank you for your interest in this project.

## Contribution Policy

This project is primarily a reference implementation and a specialized tool for high-resilience testing. **I do not actively solicit open-source contributions.**

To maintain the architectural integrity and the specific "Resilience First" vision of this framework:

1.  **Start with an Issue:** Do **not** open a Pull Request without first opening a GitHub Issue.
2.  **Define the Problem:** The issue must describe a **concrete problem** you are facing. Feature requests without a clear problem statement or "nice-to-have" refactors will likely be declined.
3.  **Unsolicited PRs:** Pull Requests that have not been discussed and approved in an issue will most likely be **rejected**.

## Customization & Consulting

If you require specific customizations, support for proprietary protocols, or integration with your enterprise environment, I am available for consulting.

Please contact me directly at: **kuba@perfluencer.pl**
